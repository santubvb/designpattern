Adapter Design Patter

	Adapter design pattern is the one of the structural design pattern and its used so that two unrelated 
interfaces can work together. The object that joins these unrelated interface is called Adapter.

	One of the great real life example is mobile charger. Mobile battery needs around 3volts to charge but 
the normal socket on wall produces 240volts in India. So mobile charger act as adapter between mobile charging 
socket and socket of the wall.

Two Way Adapter Pattern
	While implementing Adapter pattern, there are two approaches – class adapter and object adapter – however both these approaches produce same result.

Class Adapter – This form uses java inheritance and extends the source interface, in our case Socket class.
			  - example : SocketClassAdapterImpl.java
Object Adapter – This form uses Java Composition and adapter contains the source object. 
				- Example : SocketObjectAdapterImpl.java
				
Adapter Design Pattern Example in JDK
	Some of the adapter design pattern example I could easily find in JDK classes are;

	java.util.Arrays#asList()
	java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream) (returns a Reader)
	java.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream) (returns a Writer)
